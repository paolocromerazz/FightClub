            <h3>Philosophy</h3>
            <p>It is a disturbing movie which hits spectators by its philosophical radicality. Fight Club questions our obsessions,
                our phobias, habits, it shows how our species is manipulated and influenced. The film takes us back to ourselves
                and to our conscience.

            <h3>Anarchy Vs. Order</h3>
            <p>These cameos are the early signs of schizophrenia of the narrator. Tyler is anarchy, the rejection of society.
                One scene shows Tyler merchant in the gutter and the narrator on the sidewalk, which shows the two opposites,
                one bending the rules of society and the other not. Their association will lead to the creation of Fight
                Club, a sort of underground Fight Club which developed into the street and settled in various places open
                at night specifically for fighting. The Club has eight rules which the first two are most important. First
                rule: it is forbidden to talk about Fight Club Second rule: it is forbidden to talk about Fight Club These
                two rules convey the rejection of advertising and consumerism. It is worth considering the paradox of these
                rules, because in spite of themselves, the Fight Club becomes the slave system that is bent on fighting.
                What changes in this system will he suffer? After fighting organized illegal in pubs at night, the Fight
                Club will become an organization fighting for the oppressed. Tasks will be entrusted to members of Fight
                Club, which gradually will become the starting point of Project Mayhem. It aims to destroy the credit card
                companies to delete files to debtors that everyone start from scratch, which will produce chaos. There are
                two important passages in the film. The first is the passage of the mutilation, the one where Tyler throws
                acid on the hand of the Narrator. It’s a key passage when it was realized that the pair actually do one.
                It allows the development of Fight Club, “is when we realized we lost everything we are free.” The narrator
                becomes aware of its existence, is released and at the same time frees Tyler (the double), giving it an immense
                opportunity for action was limited before because of morals inculcated the narrator of our world. This act
                becomes the means to prove his membership in this group, it becomes a must for members. The second important
                passage is the revelation, when the narrator learns that he and Tyler are in fact the same person. He is
                really aware of the importance of these actions and try to fix it. Marla Singer (Helena Bonham Carter) is
                one of the few female representatives of the film. Indeed one can wonder about the integrity of the woman
                who continues to be criticized: “There is a generation of men raised by women, I’m not sure that another
                woman is the solution to our problem “. There are no women in the Fight Club and if we stick to a primary
                reading of the film, the role of Helena Bonham Carter serves only défouloir sex with men full of testosterone.
                Fortunately his role is about more than that, it is instead very important for the mental health of the narrator
                as it retains the Narrator in reality. The trio Marla / Narrator / Tyler form a united bloc, remove one of
                the elements and everything collapses. Explanation: If Tyler is present, it is thanks to the delusions of
                the narrator who brings into existence through a projection of what he wants to be. Tyler is the narrator
                for a bridge between the real world that allows it to interact with others, and the delusional world of the
                sick man played by Edward Norton. Marla is the first person that mimics the narrator and lies in attending
                meetings of dying. The narrator thought to be the one and only to do so, but it is not. Worse, it deals with
                it a market, each is split sessions so that both of them can enjoy moments of solitude with sick people.
                However, they will meet again several times, it will lead the meetings. She calls him first when she swallowed
                drugs and makes it clear that it’s just a cry for help, then it because she has a breast rotting and asked
                him to come check it out. His many contacts allow the narrator to stay inked in reality and not get lost
                in obsessive delusions that could cost him his sanity.</p>
